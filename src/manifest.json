It uses the inbuilt headerMessageId that is generated by every email when created and confirms that any duplicate email has the EXACT same size. This tool does NOT do any nesting or deduplication across folders and will ONLY remove duplicates in EACH selected folder. Run the Check for duplicates to see what would happen. Then run Delete duplicates to actually remove duplcates in your folder(s).",
